# ECommerce_SQL

This project explores and analyzes an E-Commerce platform’s backend data to uncover business insights related to customer behavior, sales performance, product trends, and seller distribution.

About the Project:

In this project, We explored the workings of an e-commerce platform using a detailed dataset that covered everything from customer locations to order details and seller information. The goal was to understand how different parts of the system interact, from shopping habits to delivery performance.

We used Python (Pandas) for data handling, SQL for running SQL queries, and built visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn, all within a Jupyter Notebook.

The Dataset

The data was structured to reflect a real-world e-commerce platform and included:

Customers & Sellers – Who they are and where they're based
* Orders & Products – What was sold, when, and how much
* Payments – Modes of transaction used
* Geolocation – Latitude/longitude for delivery analysis

Everything was first loaded into Pandas, and also pushed into a SQLite database for more flexible querying.

Why This Project?

It gave us a chance to work with realistic, multi-table datasets, use both SQL and Python in a single workflow, and turn raw data into clear insights. It really sharpened my skills in data wrangling, analysis, and storytelling through visuals.
